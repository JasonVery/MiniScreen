Welcome to my simple MiniScreen App! 
This app was specifically designed to run localy on my personal desktop as a way for me to have quick access to different features.
Some of these features include: A Simple clock that displays the time and day, a weather widget using openWeatherMap, slide show of all my favourite photos, simple music interface that allows me to play muisc from my favourite radio stations and playlists using MusicKit

In the future I want to build upon this app by making the code more industry standard like as I learn more from school and hopefully job settings.

Goals of miniScreen: Create my first solo, out of school coding project, Learn a bit of front end languages like html, css and javascript, Work with apis, Have a really cool and functional product at my desk.

While going through the source code of this project please remember: This is my FIRST solo coding ptoject dealing with languages I didnt really know, This is not meant for anyone other than myself, I am still learning and trying to have fun :)
